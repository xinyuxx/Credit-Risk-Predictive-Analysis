# Credit-Risk-Predictive-Analysis
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model and a decision support system (DSS) that evaluates the risk of Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) applications.

The dataset and additional information can be found here: https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machinelearning-challenge

Details:
1. Developed a predictive model to assess credit risk using the dataset.
2. Designed and developed a (running) prototype of an interactive interface that sales representatives in a bank/credit card company can use to decide on accepting or rejecting applications.
